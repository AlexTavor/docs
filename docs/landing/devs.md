CoCoHub lets you find hosted, community-built conversational components for your bot. We index a diverse set of components, measure their availability and make them searchable, all to make it easy to find the perfect component for the task.

In addition, our set of standards and SDKs make the integration work simple. You can use the existing integration for most instances or integrate once and get access to all of the components published on CoCoHub.

Each component is meant to fulfill a specific purpose; for example, getting a piece of information from the user, helping the user accomplish a certain task, entertaining the user, or informing them of new and relevant information.

You can call components through a simple unified, REST API that is easy to embed in your chatbot. Moreover, you can view all of the components you are using in your workspace, which monitors the number of API requests, latency, and error rates, among other metrics.
