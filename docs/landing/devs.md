CoCoHub let you find hosted community built conversational components for your bot.
We index diverse set of components, measure their availability and make them searchable. all to make it easy to find the perfect component for the job.

In addition our set of standards and SDKs make the integration work easier. use the existing integration most of the times or integrate one time and get access to all of the components published on CoCoHub.

Each component is based around a specific purpose. for example getting a piece of information from the user, help the user accomplish some task, entertain the user, or inform him of some relevant information.

call components through a simple unified, REST API that is easy to embed in your chatbot. Moreover, you can view all of the components you are using in your workspace, which monitors the number of API requests, latency, and error rates, among other metrics.
