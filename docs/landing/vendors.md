# For Component Vendors

CoCoHub lets you host and share your work with the chatbot builder community. We have the biggest repository for hosted conversational components in the world!

Each component is intended to achieve a specific purpose; for example getting a piece of information from the user, help the user accomplish some task, entertain the user, or inform them of some relevant information.

If you’ve already built an intelligent bot of your own, we make it simple for you to distribute and monetize parts of it.

Adding your component to CoCoHub has many advantages; You’ll get instant exposure to our growing user base, a search-engine-optimized profile page for your component, as well as features like user management and billing services.
