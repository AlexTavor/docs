## General
[Conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation) is an interactive communication between two or more agents(virtual or real).

Each agent has its own agenda and goals.


In the typical framing of a reinforcement learning sceanrio from each agent point of view:

1. his environment is the other agents which he observe and interpret to build his model of the world
2. he maintains state - his memory based on previous observations and his model of the world 
3. based on his state he performs actions in the environment to promote its goals

!!! note
    In a learned agent each action is paired with a reward. The agent agenda and goals are defined by these rewards.
