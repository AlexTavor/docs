All components hold context over multiple turns of conversation to better engage your users, with logic wired into the conversational flow. All you have to do is incorporate them into your bots. It\u2019s time to make the development of conversational A.I. a collaborative process. When you build on reusable and customizable parts, you create better chatbots to make conversation easy. You\u2019ll be able to stack a conversation with pre-built dialogue blocks. Each of these blocks maintains user context throughout the conversation.
